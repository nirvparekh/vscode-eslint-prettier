When multiple team members are working on the same project, it's quite often issue of formatting and ESlint settings based on the different system and editor which cause the un expected changes track on Git repo.

I'm sharing the most basic common settings for VSCode, ESLint and Prettier. Helpful for JavaScript projects.

**Editor:**
VS Code editor

**Extensions:**
[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
[Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
